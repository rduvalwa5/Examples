Process that has worked so far:

1) Everything that I have read indicates that RobotFramework does not support Python 3
  Command python setup.py egg_info failed with error code 1 in /private/tmp/pip_build_root/robotframework-ride
  Storing debug log for failure in /Users/rduvalwa2/.pip/pip.log
2) I installed Python 2.79
  a) Download and install python-2.7.9-macosx10.6.pkg
  
  b) Downlaod robotframework-2.9a1.tar.gzip
  	cd /Users/rduvalwa2/Downloads/robotframework-2.9a1
  	sudo python setup.py install
	Password:
	running install
	running build
	running build_py
	running build_scripts
	running install_lib
	running install_scripts
	changing mode of /usr/local/bin/pybot to 755
	changing mode of /usr/local/bin/rebot to 755
	running install_egg_info
	Removing /Library/Python/2.7/site-packages/robotframework-2.9a1-py2.7.egg-info <- previous install
	Writing /Library/Python/2.7/site-packages/robotframework-2.9a1-py2.7.egg-info
  
  Download robotframework-selenium2library-master.tar.gzip
  Download wxwidgets2.8_2.8.12.1.orig.tar.gzip
  	- On OS X you can try wxPython 2.9 because it supports OS X better than 2.8 releases. 
  	On latest OS X versions you should have suitable wxPython version installed by default, 
  	but unfortunately all RIDE features do not yet work on that platform.
  
  1) cd /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7  <--32 bit
  2) cd bin
  (Now this command works)
  3) pip install robotframework-ride
  4) pip install robotframework-selenium2library
